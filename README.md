This project is to exercise my understanding of Javascript basics. This project also continues my practice of the CLI as well as Git and GitHub basics.

index.html contains only boilerplate code as well as linking to rock-paper-scissors.js.

rock-paper-scissors.js contains three functions:
- function getComputerChoice() that represents the computer's choice and returns 'computerChoice', a string that is either rock, paper or scissors
- function playRound() that gets the player's choice and calls getComputerChoice() then returns 'result', an integer that represents the winner of the round
- function game() that calls calls the playRound() function until five rounds have been played without a tie and displays winner and scores
The game() function is then called so that a game begins when the page is loaded.

THIS PROJECT WAS MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
